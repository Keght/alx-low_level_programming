		0x09. C - Static libraries
		__________________________

Through this project, I learnt about the use and creation of static libraries in the C language programming.

Task 0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life.
_____	In this task we create the static library libmy.a containing different functions created in previous project in this repository.

Task 1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
____	Here we created a script that creates a static library called liball.a from all the files in the current directory.
